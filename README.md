## üìò Tasks

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Fine-tuning GPT-2 on Krishna-Inspired Text

- üîó [View Notebook](Task_1/Prodigy_AI_Internship_Task_1_CLEANED.ipynb)
- ‚ú® Description: Fine-tuned a GPT-2 model on a Krishna-themed creative dataset to generate spiritual, poetic text using Hugging Face Transformers.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Image generation from text using a pre-trained model like DALL-E or Stable diffusion.

- üîó [View Notebook](Task_2/Prodigy_AI_Internship_Task_2_CLEANED.ipynb)
- ‚ú® Description: In this task, I used a pre-prained models like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion to generate a high quality image by following the text prompt exactly.

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Text Generation using Markov Chains

- üîó [View Notebook](Task_3/Prodigy_AI_Internship_Task_3_CLEANED.ipynb)
- ‚ú® Description: Implemented a basic text generation model using Markov chains. Generated random but structured text based on learned word sequences.

### ‚úÖ Task 5: Artistic Style Transfer using Neural Networks

- üîó [View Notebook](Task_5/Prodigy_AI_Internship_Task_5_CLEANED.ipynb)
- ‚ú® Description: Applied artistic style transfer by combining the **content of one image** with the **style of another** using a pre-trained VGG-based neural style transfer model.
