## üìò Tasks

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Fine-tuning GPT-2 on Krishna-Inspired Text

- üîó [View Notebook](Task_1/Prodigy_AI_Internship_Task_1_CLEANED.ipynb)
- ‚ú® Description: Fine-tuned a GPT-2 language model on a custom dataset of Krishna-themed creative writing to generate spiritual, context-aware text using Hugging Face's Transformers library.

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Image generation from text using a pre-trained model like DALL-E or Stable diffusion.

- üîó [View Notebook](Task_2/Prodigy_AI_Internship_Task_2_CLEANED.ipynb)
- ‚ú® Description: In this task, I used a pre-prained models like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion to generate a high quality image by following the text prompt exactly.

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Text Generation using Markov Chains

- üîó [View Notebook](Task_3/Prodigy_AI_Internship_Task_3_CLEANED.ipynb)
- ‚ú® Description: Implemented a simple text generation algorithm using **Markov chains**. The model learns word sequences from sample text and generates new sentences that mimic the training style.
