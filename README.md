## 📘 Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Fine-tuning GPT-2 on Krishna-Inspired Text

- 🔗 [View Notebook](Task_1/Prodigy_AI_Internship_Task_1_CLEANED.ipynb)
- ✨ Description: In this task, I fine-tuned a GPT-2 language model on a custom dataset consisting of Krishna-themed creative writing. The goal was to generate context-aware spiritual text with GPT-2.

### ✅ Task 2: Text Classification using Naive Bayes

- 🔗 [View Notebook](Task_2/Prodigy_AI_Internship_Task_2_CLEANED.ipynb)
- ✨ Description: Built a spam vs ham text classifier using the **Naive Bayes algorithm**. This involved text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal), vectorization using `CountVectorizer`, training, and evaluating the model.
